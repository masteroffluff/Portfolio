        <h2>Mixed Messages</h2>
        <p>The aim of this project was to generate a random phrase. Working with 2 fellow students we came up with the concept of a animal doing something to another animal. As the 2 other guys had done english as a foreign language courses one suggested we also includ a phrase showing the same action in the past tense.</p>
        <p>I went for a simple style for this project as it was to shwcase the coding. I trried for a businesslike plain style for the styleing</p>

        <h2>Jammming</h2>
        <p> My first project in React and interacting with APIs, this downloads a track listing based on a search term from Spotify and allows you to build a playlist. Most of the previous projects </p>
        <p>I decided to style it like an old fashioned led matrix car stereo interface.</p>

        <h2>ACME Ecommerce Site</h2>
        <p> This project is in 2 parts the first is the back end which uses PostgreSQL and OpenAPI Specification and the front end which uses React with Redux. I am using stripe on both side to handle payment (its currently set in test mode ðŸ˜Š) I picked the ACME Company from Warner Brothers as my source of inspriation and the store sells items based on the those that appear in the cartoons. Note: if you want to try ordering out for yourself i would suggest using credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 expiry date:12/34 cvc code :123 and whatever name in the name field.</p>

        <h2>Fluffbook</h2>
        <p> My final project for the Codecaademy. This is a personal organiser app with some slight social media elements. I used test based development for the front end which presented some interesing challenges. I also tried to do more with less libraries and tried to create my own methods for items such as React Forms.</p>
