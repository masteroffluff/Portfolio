                    <div class="col p-1">I've worked in a couple of different roles that were adjacent to IT
                        development, for instance
                        Developing spreadsheet automation apps in vba for a accounts department, managing
                        incident

                        and VBA. I've touched on a few other languages such as C# and GameMaker. My latest role
                        had had
                        me focus much more on my soft sklill such as meeting management and managing
                        stakeholders. I'm
                        particularily good at chairing online meetings with large attendences.

                <h3>Mixed Messages</h3>
                <p>The aim of this project was to generate a random phrase. Working with 2 fellow students we came up
                    with the concept of a animal doing something to another animal. As the 2 other guys had done English
                    as a foreign language courses one suggested we also include a phrase showing the same action in the
                    past tense.</p>
                <p>I went for a simple style for this project as it was to showcase the coding. I tried for a
                    businesslike plain style for the styling.</p>

                <h3>Jammming</h3>
                <p> My first project in React and interacting with APIs, this downloads a track listing based on a
                    search term from Spotify and allows you to build a playlist. It is a demonstration of passing state
                    through the react component structure using props and callbacks. This was the first time i used
                    authentication to a third party site. </p>
                <p>I decided to style it like an old fashioned led matrix car stereo interface.</p>

                <!--         <h3>Reddit Browser</h3>
            <p> This project is a recat site that uses reddits API to display reddit posts. The challenge here was working with large JSON sets and various media types.</p>

                <h3>ACME E-commerce Site</h3>
                <p> This project is in 2 parts the first is the back end which uses PostgreSQL and OpenAPI Specification
                    and the front end which uses React with Redux. I am using stripe on both side to handle payment (its
                    currently set in test mode 😊) I picked the ACME Company from Warner Brothers as my source of
                    inspiration and the store sells items based on the those that appear in the cartoons. Note: if you
                    want to try ordering out for yourself i would suggest using credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242
                    expiry date:12/34 cvc code :123 and whatever name in the name field.</p>
                <p>Please note the database for this site is currently suspended. </p>

                <h3>Fluffbook</h3>
                <p> My final project for the Codecademy. This is a personal organiser app with some slight social media
                    elements. I used test based development for the front end which presented some interesting
                    challenges. I also tried to do more with less libraries and tried to create my own methods for items
                    such as React Forms.</p>
