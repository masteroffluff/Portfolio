        <p>Hi my name is Chris and this is my Portfolio</p>
        <p>I'm currently working as part of the SAP S4Hana Product Platform team as Hypercare lead for Maersk.</p>
        <p>Also I'm studying the Full Stack Engineering course on Codecademy</p>
        <p>I've worked in a couple of different roles that were adjacent to IT development, for instance Developing spreadsheet automation apps in vba for a accounts department, managing incident esclations and user stories.</p>
        <p>My coding skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript and VBA. I've touched on a few other languages such as python, C# and GameMaker. My latest role had had me focus much more on my soft sklill such as meeting management and managing stakeholders. I'm particularily good at chairing online meetings with large attendences.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are playing role playing games and board games, DIY, and making bad photoshop art.</p>>
